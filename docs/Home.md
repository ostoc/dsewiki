# About this wiki

This wiki is related the [DSE Master program at TU Dresden](https://tu-dresden.de/ing/informatik/sya/se/master-dse). You can find lecture notes, past exams here.

# Modules and courses

The DSE Master program at TU Dresden requires students to complete modules, as opposed to only completing particular exercises. One module can require one or more subjects, i.e., one or more exams, and performance in them will be combined to an overall module grade.

## Mandatory Modules

**Systems Engineering**

- [System Engineering I](courses/System-Engineering-I)
- [System Engineering II](courses/System-Engineering-II)

**Ubiquitous Systems**

- [Distributed Systems](courses/Distributed-Systems)
- [Mobile Communication and Computing](courses/Mobile-Communication-and-Computing)

**Transactional & Secure Platforms**

- [Transactional Information Systems](courses/Transactional-Information-Systems)
- [Security and Cryptography I](courses/Security-and-Cryptography-I)

**System Design**

- [Design Patterns and Frameworks](courses/Design-Patterns-and-Frameworks)

## Elective Modules

- [Security and Cryptography II](courses/Security-and-Cryptography-II)
- [Wireless Sensor Networks](courses/Wireless-Sensor-Networks)
- [Distributed Operating Systems](courses/Distributed-Operating-Systems)
- [Component-based Software Engineering](courses/Component-based-Software-Engineering)
- [Internet and Web Applications](courses/Internet-and-Web-Applications)
- [Application Development for Mobile & Ubiquitous Computing](courses/Application-Development-for-Mobile-and-Ubiquitous-Computing)
- [Foundations of Concurrent and Distributed Systems](courses/Foundations-of-Concurrent-and-Distributed-Systems)
- Prediction and Estimation Techniques (No Page)
- [Software Fault Tolerance](courses/Software-Fault-Tolerance)
- [Microkernel-based Operating Systems](/courses/Microkernel-based-Operating-Systems)
- [Real-Time Systems](courses/Real-Time-Systems)
- [Principles of Dependable Systems](courses/Principles-of-Dependable-Systems)
- Foundations to Computational Logic (No Page)

## Internship/Programming Project

After having completed the module, students will be able to independently accomplish individual research projects that focus on the practical application of the skills acquired during studies to distributed systems. They will have learned to analyse complex tasks and work out efficient solutions. This will enable them to understand and discuss practical scenarios in their professional lives and find feasible solutions.
